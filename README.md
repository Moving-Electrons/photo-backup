# Backing Up Photos on the go with a Raspberry Pi

This project contains python scripts for using the [Raspberri](https://amzn.to/2MZrHp4) Pi and [Adafruit OLED Bonnet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3531)  as a backup device to transfer files/photos between USB devices connected to the Raspberry Pi. In order to make the process more efficient nad less time consuming, the backup is incremental, so only new files are copied.
